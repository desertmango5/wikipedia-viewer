# wikipedia-viewer
FCC Project

Search Wikipedia.  When a result is clicked, the Wikipedia page is displayed  in a modal (on medium & large screens) so you do not have to open a new browser tab every time you clink on a result link. Random button displays in a modal a random Wikipedia article. Minimalist styling is meant to reflect the styling of Wikipedia itself. (Modals not used on small screens due to the way Wikipedia is rendered in a small iframe. On a small screen, clicking a search result will open a new browser window.)
